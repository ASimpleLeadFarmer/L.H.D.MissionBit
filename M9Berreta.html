<p>You take out your M9 and shoot the teacher four times. He falls limp and you get up and go on your way. On your trip back to the bus, you find four guys from B-Company aka "Bad Company". They hand you an AEK-972, the 5.56 Nato chambered version of the AEK-971, after you agree to join them. You and Bad Company are picked up by a UH-60 and brought to a near by army base.</p>

<p>YOU SURVIVE!!!!!</p>
